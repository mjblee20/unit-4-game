Name: StarCraft 2 RPG

In this game, player will first choose their character. Then they will pick the first opponent they'd like to face. Player MUST defeat all opponents to be victorious. If player's character's health is depleted, player losses.

## Combat

When player's character attacks, their next attack will be increase by a multiple of 1 of their original attack damage.
When the defender is attacked, they will automatically counter attack player's character with a preset counter attack damage.

## Notes

There are a few actions that will break the game but I am currently struggling to find the solution to fix my code.
My reset button is not functioning correctly.

## Future Development Ideas

* Introduce more characters
* Balance out the game more by adjusting health, attack values and counter attack values
* Improve the aesthetics of the webpage.
